**recommendationHandler.js**
----------------------------

`recommendationHandler.js` introduces the `RecommendationHandler` class, pivotal for managing the recommendation system's frontend logic on the Redwood Prototype. This class is instrumental in fetching, displaying, and interacting with user recommendations, creating a dynamic and personalized user experience through the integration of various APIs and UI components.

Key Functionalities
--------------------

- **Dynamic Recommendation Fetching and Display:** Manages the lifecycle of user recommendations, from fetching and updating recommendations based on user interaction history to dynamic display.

.. method:: loadNextRecommendation()
  
  Loads and displays the next recommendation, handling the transition between current and upcoming recommendations seamlessly.
  
.. method:: fetchRecommendations()
  
  Fetches new recommendations from the server, updating the state to reflect the latest set of recommendations available for the user.

- **User Interaction Recording:** Captures and processes user interactions with recommendations, such as likes, dislikes, and superlikes, influencing the recommendation logic.

.. method:: recordInteraction(recommendationId, recName, interactionType)
  
  Records a user's interaction with a recommendation, updating both the local state and the server-side logic to reflect the user's preferences.

- **Geographical Data and Calendar Integration:** Incorporates geographical data visualization and calendar functionalities, enhancing the depth of information available in recommendations.

.. method:: displayRecommendation(rec)
  
  Dynamically updates the UI to display detailed information about a recommendation, incorporating user features, geographical data and more.

Integration and Usage
----------------------

`RecommendationHandler` serves as a cornerstone for the recommendation system within the Redwood Prototype, integrating tightly with various components of the platform to offer a comprehensive and interactive user experience.

- **Integrated with MapManager and DatePicker:** Enhances recommendations with geographical data visualization and calendar visualization, provided by `MapManager` and `DatePicker`, respectively.

- **Utilizes Utility Modules and External Data:** Leverages `recommendationApi.js` for fetching recommendations and recording interactions, `modalDisplay.js` for modals related to mutual interests and reporting, and `api.js` for fetching images.

- **Categorization of User Features:** Through integration with `features.js`, it categorizes user features into "About Me," "Lifestyle," and "Interests," enriching the recommendation profiles.
