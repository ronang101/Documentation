Introduction
============

Welcome to the Redwood Prototype documentation. The Redwood Prototype is a cutting-edge web platform designed specifically for renters looking to find compatible roommates. It acts as a virtual meeting ground, leveraging recommendation algorithms to pair users with potential roommates who share similar living preferences and habits. This documentation delves into the technical composition of the Redwood Prototype, including its backend logic, frontend architecture, and the database set up.

Project Overview
----------------

The mission of the Redwood Prototype is to transform the renting experience by facilitating the search for ideal roommate matches. It harnesses the power of multiple matching algorithms to provide personalized recommendations, tailored to the individual preferences and behaviors of its users. The platform is crafted to respond dynamically to user feedback, ensuring an adaptive and continually improving matchmaking process. While the Redwood Prototype's primary focus is on enhancing the renting and roommate-finding experience, its versatile architecture allows for potential applications in other domains, such as e-commerce and social networking, demonstrating its broad utility in the digital realm.

Technical Highlights
--------------------

At the heart of the Redwood Prototype are our matching algorithms, including content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, which work in tandem to analyze user data and predict compatibility. The platform is constructed with robust technologies like postgresql for data retrieval, NumPy for mathematical computations and Flask for backend development, facilitating a smooth user experience and efficient data handling.

Audience
--------

This document is crafted for incoming software developers, data scientists, and project collaborators who will contribute to the evolution of the Redwood Prototype, as well as stakeholders looking to gain a deeper understanding of its technical framework. Additionally, it serves as a valuable resource for prospective users and decision-makers eager to learn about the inner workings of the recommendation system and its practical advantages.
