Additionally, Python's popularity and large community support mean that emerging trends and advancements in technology can be readily integrated into Redwood.

.. _Decision 2:

Decision 2: Generating and Storing Sets of 30 Recommendations for Dynamic Updates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Decision Made**:

The system generates and stores 30 recommendations at a time for each user. After the user has interacted with all 30 recommendations, their preferences are updated, and a new set of 30 recommendations is generated.

**Reasoning**:

This approach balances the efficiency of batch processing with the need for dynamic, real-time updates. By processing a set number of recommendations in batches, the system can manage computational resources more effectively. This number (30) is chosen based on the assumption that a user's preferences are unlikely to change significantly within a smaller set of interactions, thus providing a more stable basis for generating relevant recommendations.

**Alternatives Considered**:

Real-Time Recommendation Generation: Generating recommendations in real-time for each user interaction. While this ensures the most up-to-date recommendations, it can be computationally intensive and may not significantly improve the user experience due to the relatively stable nature of user preferences.

Larger Batch Processing: Generating a larger batch of recommendations at a time. This could reduce the frequency of updates but might lead to less relevant recommendations over time as user preferences evolve.

**Project Objectives Alignment**:

This strategy aligns well with the core objective of providing relevant and personalized roommate recommendations. It ensures that the recommendations are updated frequently enough to reflect changing user preferences while maintaining system efficiency.

**Future Implications**:

This approach provides a scalable framework for the recommendation system. It allows for adjustments in the batch size based on future insights into user behavior and system performance. The balance between batch processing and real-time updates offers flexibility to adapt to changing user needs and technological advancements.
However it is worth noting that each time we have to fetch another set of 30 recommendations we must re-filter the set of users to get candidates and then recalculate dot products for cosine similarity which may not be the most efficient. In the future when the user base grows too large we may have to strike a balance between up to date exact recommendations vs approximate recommendations where we generate recommendations in a large batch and make small updates as we go.

.. _Decision 3:

Decision 3: Using Cosine Similarity for Recommendation Metrics
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Decision Made**:

Implementing cosine similarity as the primary metric for collaborative and content-based filtering in the recommendation system.

**Reasoning**:

Cosine similarity is particularly effective for high-dimensional data, common in recommendation systems.
