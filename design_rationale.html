<span id="decision-1"></span><h2>Decision 1: Choosing Python for Backend Development<a class="headerlink" href="#decision-1-choosing-python-for-backend-development" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Decision Made</strong>:</p>
<p>The backend of the Redwood Prototype is developed using Python.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning</strong>:</p>
<p>Python is known for its extensive support and libraries in machine learning and data processing, making it an ideal choice for developing simple or complex recommendation systems. Its simplicity and readability also contribute to easier maintenance and collaborative development. Moreover, Python’s widespread adoption in the tech community ensures a robust support network and continuous updates, which are vital for a project focusing on cutting-edge features.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives Considered</strong>:</p>
<p>Node.js: Known for its high performance and scalability in handling numerous connections simultaneously, making it a strong contender for backend development. However, it may not have as straightforward integration with machine learning libraries compared to Python.</p>
<p>Java: Offers robust performance and is widely used in large-scale systems. However, it does not provide the same ease of use for machine learning and data processing tasks as Python.</p>
<p>Ruby: Known for its easy syntax and rapid development capabilities, but it also lacks the extensive machine learning libraries and community support that Python offers.</p>

<section id="decision-2-generating-and-storing-sets-of-30-recommendations-for-dynamic-updates">
<span id="decision-2"></span><h2>Decision 2: Generating and Storing Sets of 30 Recommendations for Dynamic Updates<a class="headerlink" href="#decision-2-generating-and-storing-sets-of-30-recommendations-for-dynamic-updates" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Decision Made</strong>:</p>
<p>The system generates and stores 30 recommendations at a time for each user. After the user has interacted with all 30 recommendations, their preferences are updated, and a new set of 30 recommendations is generated.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning</strong>:</p>
<p>This approach balances the efficiency of batch processing with the need for dynamic, real-time updates. By processing a set number of recommendations in batches, the system can manage computational resources more effectively. This number (30) is chosen based on the assumption that a user’s preferences are unlikely to change significantly within a smaller set of interactions, thus providing a more stable basis for generating relevant recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives Considered</strong>:</p>
<p>Real-Time Recommendation Generation: Generating recommendations in real-time for each user interaction. While this ensures the most up-to-date recommendations, it can be computationally intensive and may not significantly improve the user experience due to the relatively stable nature of user preferences.</p>
<p>Larger Batch Processing: Generating a larger batch of recommendations at a time. This could reduce the frequency of updates but might lead to less relevant recommendations over time as user preferences evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objectives Alignment</strong>:</p>
<p>This strategy aligns well with the core objective of providing relevant and personalized roommate recommendations. It ensures that the recommendations are updated frequently enough to reflect changing user preferences while maintaining system efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Future Implications</strong>:</p>
<p>This approach provides a scalable framework for the recommendation system. It allows for adjustments in the batch size based on future insights into user behavior and system performance. The balance between batch processing and real-time updates offers flexibility to adapt to changing user needs and technological advancements.
However it is worth noting that each time we have to fetch another set of 30 recommendations we must re-filter the set of users to get candidates and then recalculate dot products for cosine similarity which may not be the most efficient. In the future when the user base grows too large we may have to strike a balance between up to date exact recommendations vs approximate recommendations where we generate recommendations in a large batch and make small updates as we go.</p>

<section id="decision-3-using-cosine-similarity-for-recommendation-metrics">
<span id="decision-3"></span><h2>Decision 3: Using Cosine Similarity for Recommendation Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#decision-3-using-cosine-similarity-for-recommendation-metrics" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Decision Made</strong>:</p>
<p>Implementing cosine similarity as the primary metric for collaborative and content-based filtering in the recommendation system.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning</strong>:</p>
<p>Cosine similarity is particularly effective for high-dimensional data, common in recommendation systems. It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, in this case, user preference or feature vectors, which is a robust indicator of similarity in user preferences or characteristics. This metric is advantageous for its insensitivity to the magnitude of the vectors, focusing solely on orientation, which is ideal for comparing user profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives Considered</strong>:</p>
<p>Euclidean Distance: While useful for measuring direct distances between points, it can be less effective in high-dimensional spaces where the notion of ‘distance’ becomes less intuitive.</p>
<p>Pearson Correlation: Measures linear correlation between two variables but may not perform as well in scenarios where the relationship is not linear.</p>
<p>Jaccard Index: Useful for measuring similarities between sets, but less effective for the type of numerical, high-dimensional data typically found in user profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objectives Alignment</strong>:</p>
<p>Using cosine similarity aligns with the objective of creating an effective and user-friendly roommate matching system. It ensures that the recommendations are based on meaningful similarities in user preferences and characteristics, leading to more compatible matches.</p>
